Pig game is a simple dice game.

<h2>HOW TO PLAY?</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</li>
                <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score ("CURRENT").</li>
                <li>IF the player rolls <strong>'1'</strong> he loses all of his ROUND points. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his MAIN score. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>The first player to reach <strong>100</strong> points on MAIN score wins the game.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>GOOD LUCK!</h3>
